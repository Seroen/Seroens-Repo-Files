HOW TO INSTALL:
- To install level editor projects, you need to download the LevelEditorProjects folder from the github repository and place its content into your local LevelEditorProjects folder (found in the same folder as the editor executable).
- To install custom tiles or props, you need to download the Prop Packs or Tile Packs folders from the github repository. These folders contain several packs. Choose which ones you want, then extract the packs' content into your local Graphics 
folder (if it's a tile pack) or into your local Props folder (if it's a prop pack). These folders can be found in the same folder as the editor executable. After that, copy the content of the Init.txt file of each pack at the end of the Init.txt
file found in your local Graphics folder (if it's a tile pack) or in your local Props folder (if it's a prop pack).
- If you want to install all the Graphics and Props just copy the Graphics and Props folders into the editor do be aware if you have any tiles you wish to keep that you or someone else has made please take them out and then put them back in 

NOTES:
- If you copied a prop initialisation text into the Init.txt of the Graphics folder, you will get a *Property not found* error message and the editor will crash.
- The vanilla editor has a tile preview limit. When this limit is reached, tiles no longer have previews when you place them. However, they will still render correctly.
- Some tiles are made to be used as props, just place them from the Tiles as Props categories in the prop editor.
- If you have any questions, send a direct message to Solaristheworstcatever#5222 on Discord.
