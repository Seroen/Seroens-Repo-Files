# Rain-World-Custom-Tiles-and-Props
A repository to keep most of the tiles and props created by the Rain World community members and to share more easily them with others.

A few rules to upload your files:
- check a tile/prop of the same name isn't already on the repo;
- prefer pull requests (direct commits can become messy);
- never replace the whole Copy To Init.txt or Replace To Init.txt files from this repo, edit or compare instead;
- make sure your tile/prop works;
- make sure it doesn't break anything that relies on tile/prop/category order;
- if it's a tile, make sure the preview works properly;
- make sure to put any new category at the end of the init file;
- prefer new custom categories **(optional)**;
- if it's a tile, if possible, make your tile specs enough readable **(optional)**;
- tile/prop fixes are allowed if they make the tile/prop work better than before;
- put your name in the credits file with the tiles you made **(optional)**;

Credit template:
- *[insert contributor(s) name(s) here]* for the *[tile(s)/prop(s)/tile fixe(s)/prop fixe(s)]*: *[insert your tile(s)/prop(s)/tile fixe(s)/prop fixe(s) name(s) here]* **or** in the category(ies) *[insert you category(ies) name(s) here]*;

Optionally, you can add the editor dependencies after the name: (COM) for RW Community Editor, (MSC) for MSC editor, (DR) for Drought editor... Features that require the vanilla editor will (should) work on all, so you don't need to add (VAN).
(One day they will be merged)

If you can't upload files to github, send them to someone else who can and accepts to do it for you.
That's all I think, have fun!

**Warning: The editor has a tile preview limit. Once the limit is reached, tiles won't have any preview. However, they will still render well. You can fix this by uninstalling some tiles or download the Community editor.**
