To install all of this you need to first drop all the leveleditorprojects folders conetents into the World folder present within the leveleditor projects folder
and to install all the tiles and props you to select everything and dump it into either the graphics and or props folders (DO NOT REPLACE THE FOLDER) 
and once youve done that theres a txt file called "copy to init" open that and copy all the contents and place it at the end of the actual init.txt and your done
if you have any questions dm me at Solaristheworstcatever#5222 k enjoy my collection of region stuff
You install the Tile Packs the same you would normally install a Tile
