To install **level editor projects**, you need to download the **LevelEditorProjects** folder from the github repository and place its content into your **local LevelEditorProjects folder** (found in the same folder as the editor executable).
To install **custom tiles** or **props**, you need to download the **Prop Packs** or **Tile Packs** folders from the github repository. These folders contain several packs. Choose which ones you want, then extract the packs' content into your **local Graphics 
folder** (if it's a tile pack) or into your **local Props folder** (if it's a prop pack). These folders can be found in the same folder as the editor executable. After that, copy the content of the **Copy to Init.txt file** of each pack **at the end of the Init.txt
file** found in your **local Graphics folder** (if it's a tile pack) or in your **local Props folder** (if it's a prop pack).
If you want to install __all__ the **custom tiles** and **props**, download the **Graphics** and **Props** folders from the github repository, then merge them with your **local Graphics and Props folders** (found in the same folder as the editor executable). Do not delete or replace the original folders with the new ones, just merge them. After that, copy the content of the **Copy to Init.txt file** of each folder you've just downloaded **at the end of the Init.txt
file** from your **local Graphics and Props folders**.

**NOTES:**
If you copied a __**prop** initialisation text__ into the Init.txt of the Graphics folder, you will get a *Property not found* error message and the editor will crash.
The **vanilla** editor has a tile preview limit. When this limit is reached, tiles __no longer have previews__ when you place them. However, they will still __render correctly__.
Some __tiles__ are made to be used as __props__, just place them from the Tiles as Props categories in the prop editor.
If you have any questions, send a direct message to **Solaristheworstcatever#5222** on __Discord__.
